= RELEASE HISTORY


== 1.1 / 2009-11-19

This release includes two significant adjustments.

First, the conventional plugin directory has been renamed to 'plugins/',
instead of 'plugin/'. I frequently shy away from plural names
(as in the tendency in Ruby), but in this case I believe it helps
differentiate it from regular library directories. It also frees 'plugin/'
should any separate scripts be required for this project in the future.

Second, should one need to search outside of the conventional 'plugins/'
location, the #find method will accept a :directory option. This usage
is discouraged, but is made available for the rare cases in which it
might prove necessary.

Changes:

* Standard Plugin directory is 'plugins/' instead of 'plugin/'.
* Can specify an alternate plugin directory by passing an option to #find.


== 1.0 / 2009-11-24

This is the first official public release of Plugin.
Plugin provides a very easy way to locate plugins, and
this making it super easy for your project to support
pluggable components.

Changes:

* Happy Birthday
