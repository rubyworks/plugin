== DESCRIPTION

Plugin is a straighforward plugin manager for Ruby. It can handle
RubyGems, Rolls and Ruby's standard site locals. It is both more
flexible and more robust the using Gem.find_files or searching the
$LOAD_PATH manually.

The Plugin library does two signifficant things. First it designates
a location in the ruby $LOAD_PATH for plugins. Second it provides
an easy to use function for finding plugin scripts stored in the
designated location.


== USAGE

Place all plugins for your project in <tt>lib/plugins/<name>/</tt>.
Or if you have altered the load path for your project, you can
place them in the alternate location, <tt><alternate-loadpath>/plugins/<name>/</tt>.[1]

To find plugins, simply provide a glob to the <tt>Plugin.find</tt> function,
and it will return all matches found within current and/or most recent versions
of libraries.

For example, a common use case for a pluggable application is to require all
the plugins found:

  require 'plugin'

  Plugin.find('myapp/*.rb').each do |file|
    require(file)
  end

Alternately you might load plugins only as needed. For instance, if a command-line
option calls for it.

[1] Alterating the conventional load path shoud be avoided whenever possible.
