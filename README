== DESCRIPTION

Plugin is a straighforward plugin manager for Ruby.
It can handle RubyGems, Rolls and Ruby's standard
site locals.


== USAGE

The Plugin library does two signifficant things. First it designates
a location in the ruby $LOAD_PATH for plugins. Second it provides
an easy to use function for finding plugins scripts stored in the
designated location.

Place all plugin code in your project's <tt>lib/plugin/<name>/</tt>,
or if you have alterated the load path for your project, you can
place it in the alternative location under 'plugin/<name>'.

To find plugins, simply provide a path or file glob to the
<tt>Plugin.find</tt> function, and it will return all matches
found within current and most recent versions of libraries.

For example, it wil be common for pluggable applications to load all
the plugins they find:

  require 'plugin'

  Plugin.find('myapp/*.rb').each do |file|
    require file
  end

Alternately you might load plugins only as needs. Say, it a command-line
call required it.
